                    Space, the human condition, and computer programming, in my opinion, are the last frontiers of exploration.

                    Since I was a child, puzzles were often my go to for curiosity satisfaction. I would spend hours getting but a few pieces in place but never lost interest. My love for puzzles carried over into my interactions with people. So because an average student from rural Alabama had limited chances on becoming an astronaut, I chose to focus on humans and learning how and why people behave. Thus, during college I became a bartender because there is no better way of accumulating a vast amount of knowledge in a short amount of in one place than an establishment that serves booze.

                    Now that I have spent 12 years in the Hospitality industry I have decided another type of puzzle, computer programming. I am 3 weeks into my full stack development course and I feel the same way as I did as a child playing with my puzzles. I look forward to the never ending learning process of developing software.
